# Introduction

My name is Chavi, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Analytics and Applied Statistics until June 2020.\
I leveraged data and statistical concepts to analyze areas of improvement, root cause issues, test hypotheses, and identify optimal solutions.

# About This Page

In this website, I will showcase my current or previous works around machine learning and analytics.

The topics that I am interested in are around Regression, Multiclass Classifications, and Neural Networks modelling.
